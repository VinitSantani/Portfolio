Hi there!

I am Vinit Santani. I am a detail-focused individual with knowledge in data warehousing, process validation and business needs analysis. I am able to understand customer requirements and translate into actionable project plans. I am also dedicated and hard-working with passion for Big Data and data visualizing tools. 

I am actively seeking full-time work opportunities throughout the United States. I am interested in roles of a Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or a Data Scientist. Please reach out to me with any relevant openings in the job market and/or referrals. Also, please connect me with someone you know is hiring. I would highly appreciate that.

Having my own professional website (https://vinitsantani.github.io/Portfolio/) was a always a dream which has now come true with some amazing design templates by HTML5 UP. You can view my entire professional profile on my website and reach out to me via my socials and contact information.

Thank you,
Vinit Santani.
